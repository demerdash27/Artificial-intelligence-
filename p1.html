Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been identified as one of the strategic priorities for IP5 co-operation. Following a request from IP5 Industry and an agreement by the IP5 Heads of Office in New Orleans in June 2018 to explore the impact of AI on the patent system, the EPO invited the IP5 Offices to an expert round table discussion in Munich on the legal aspects of patenting of AI.

The IP5 experts focussed their discussions on four main topics: inventorship/ownership, patent eligibility, sufficiency of disclosure and inventive step.

At their meeting in June 2019, the IP5 Heads of Office agreed to make a summary report of the round table discussion available to the public.One of the key feature that distinguish us, humans, from every thing else in the world is intelligence. This ability to understand, apply knowledge and improve skills has played significant role in our evolution and establishing human civilisation. But many people (including Elon Musk) believe that the advancement in technology can create super intelligence that can threaten human existence.

“Within thirty years, we will have the technological
means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after,
 the human era will be ended.” Vernor Vinge
In his article The Coming Technological Singularity: 
 How to Survive in the Post-Human Era written in 1993, Vernor Vinge explains Singularity , the possible causes, and how we can survive. Singularity is a point where our models (mental models to be precise) must be discarded and a new reality rules. This is possible by a self evolving intelligence which can improve more rapidly than we could ever imagine. This artificial super intelligence may possess more cognitive capabilities than gifted humans beings.
