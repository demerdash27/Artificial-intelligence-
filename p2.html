    <td>Artificial intelligence (AI) is studying an artificially created, intelligent agent, or a machine to use the colloquial term. Such machines have the ability to learn about the world that surrounds them and take actions that will have the best chances of achieving success. Research into AI involves using a lot of tools from other sciences such as psychology, linguistics, computer science, and many others. It also overlaps with other fields of study, such as facial recognition, robotics, data mining, and others. As we can see, AI is a very broad term. Now, let’s take a look at human intelligence.</td>
    <td>Human intelligence involves a person’s mind to learn from his or her previous experiences. This could be their education, work experiences, or simply a situation that they found themselves in and have learned something from it. Most importantly, there are many types of information a human mind can provide. For example, a person can talk about an observation during a trip abroad or on their daily morning commute to work and give some valuable insight into their field of study or expertise. Now that we have an understanding of both intelligence types, let’s compare AI vs. human intelligence to see if we can spot some interesting differences.</td>
